Hi, just your friendly neighborhood JustNoSinclair bot here!  The domain this post links to is owned or operated by [Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_owned_or_operated_by_Sinclair_Broadcast_Group).  It is my duty to inform my fellow redditors when they are consuming media distributed by a Sinclair-owned media outlet.  The article linked above may not show any bias, and the local journalists are likely just trying to do their jobs.   However, it is important to keep an informed perspective on potential propaganda or intentionally biased reporting.  Please consider looking for alternative sources reporting on the topic.  I hope to be able to provide alternative articles in the future, but I cannot currently do so.

I was created in response to the blatant propaganda segment that Sinclair scripted and required their local news programs to present, which was later [cut together and published on YouTube](https://youtu.be/hWLjYJ4BzvI).  PBS NewsHour has reported on Sinclair's ["partisan tilt on trusted local news"](https://youtu.be/zNhUk5v3ohE).  John Oliver has [featured a segment on his show](https://youtu.be/GvtNyOzGogc), Last Week Tonight, on Sinclair.  Rolling Stone published an article titled ["Sinclair Broadcasting's Hostile Takeover"](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/sinclair-broadcast-group-hostile-takeover-trump-w519331).  Some anonymous journalists from an unidentified Sinclair news station published a narrative essay on Vox titled ["We're journalists at a Sinclair news station. We're pissed."](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/4/5/17202336/sinclair-broadcasting-promo-deadspin).  Rolling Stone has published an article titled ["Sinclair Broadcasting's Hostile Takeover"](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/sinclair-broadcast-group-hostile-takeover-trump-w519331).
