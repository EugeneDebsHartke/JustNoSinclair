Rolling Stone just recently published an article titled ["Sinclair Broadcasting's Hostile Takeover"](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/sinclair-broadcast-group-hostile-takeover-trump-w519331).  PBS NewsHour [has reported on Sinclair's "partisan tilt on trusted local news"](https://youtu.be/zNhUk5v3ohE).  John Oliver has [featured a segment on his show](https://youtu.be/GvtNyOzGogc), Last Week Tonight, on Sinclair.  Most recently, Sinclair has had an instance of numerous news reports using the exact same script for a Sinclair-provided segment [cut together and published on YouTube](https://youtu.be/hWLjYJ4BzvI).
